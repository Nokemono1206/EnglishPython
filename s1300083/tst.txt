Do you know the famous word, "Of the people, By the people, For the people.". This is said by Linkerne(1848~1885).
I think he is a time-traveler. There are 2 reasons. At first, because that word is too cool. At second,
anagram the "Linkerne". It will be the "IN KERNEL". Kernel is In machine learning, the kernel embedding of 
distributions (also called the kernel mean or mean map) comprises a class of nonparametric methods 
in which a probability distribution is represented as an element of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).
These means he was the time-traveler.
